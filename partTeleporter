--[[
a simple teleporter from part to part, it is simple, you just have to have two parts, give it the name you want (as shown in the code) and in the script alike, and a ClickDistance to both parts
old thingy (can view it as i dont have the regular credits), but it still works and maybe you can find it in a lost account that i have haha

-- This is a script writed on Luau! Made by calternar on discord.

-- This script stay on the context of a "SourceBlock" and a "DestinationBlock", teleport is from SB to DB; each block use "ClickDetector", that when you click it, it teleports
-- I will guide you across the short of this code, stay tuned!

local TeleportSource = workspace:FindFirstChild("TeleportDNI1") -- This is to found dedicated Block, you can modify this as you will to find your block
local TeleportDestination = workspace:FindFirstChild("TeleportDNI2") -- This is to found dedicated Block, you can modify this as you will to find your block

local function onTeleportClicked(player, source, destination) -- function
	local character = player.Character -- definition
	if character then
		character:SetPrimaryPartCFrame(destination.CFrame) -- teleport
		print("Teleporting " .. player.Name .. " from " .. source.Name .. " to " .. destination.Name) -- Depuration, this is to register or check the code on your Output
	end
end

local sourceClickDetector = TeleportSource:FindFirstChild("ClickDetector") -- found "ClickDetector" on source block
local destinationClickDetector = TeleportDestination:FindFirstChild("ClickDetector") -- same, for destination block

if sourceClickDetector and destinationClickDetector then
	sourceClickDetector.MouseClick:Connect(function(player)
		onTeleportClicked(player, TeleportSource, TeleportDestination) -- on click, this will teleport you by source code
	end)

	destinationClickDetector.MouseClick:Connect(function(player)
		onTeleportClicked(player, TeleportDestination, TeleportSource) -- same, destination block
	end)
end

-- Thx for reading this short code! Stay tuned for more
